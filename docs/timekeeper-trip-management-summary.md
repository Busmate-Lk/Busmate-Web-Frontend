# TimeKeeper Trip Management - Quick Summary

## What Was Implemented

✅ **New Trip Management Page for TimeKeepers** (`/timeKeeper/trip`)

- View trips passing through assigned bus stop
- Read-only schedule viewing
- Bus removal/reassignment for trips starting at their stop
- Advanced filtering and search
- Trip statistics dashboard

## New Components Created

1. **BusReassignmentModal.tsx** - Modal for managing bus assignments
   - Location: `src/components/timeKeeper/trips/BusReassignmentModal.tsx`
   - Features: Remove or reassign buses with mandatory reason field

## Updated Components

1. **page.tsx** - Main timekeeper trip management page

   - Location: `src/app/timeKeeper/(authenticated)/trip/page.tsx`
   - Added: Bus management functionality, permission checks, modal integration

2. **TimeKeeperTripsTable.tsx** - Trips display table
   - Location: `src/components/timeKeeper/trips/TimeKeeperTripsTable.tsx`
   - Added: Bus reassignment action button, permission-based rendering

## Key Features

### What TimeKeepers Can Do:

- ✅ View all trips at their assigned bus stop
- ✅ View trip details (read-only)
- ✅ Add notes to trips
- ✅ **Remove buses** from trips starting at their stop
- ✅ **Reassign buses** to trips starting at their stop
- ✅ Filter and search trips
- ✅ View trip statistics

### What TimeKeepers Cannot Do:

- ❌ Edit schedules or trip details
- ❌ Create or delete trips
- ❌ Manage trips not starting at their stop
- ❌ Assign PSPs
- ❌ Start/complete/cancel trips

## Business Rules

**Bus Management Eligibility:**

- Only for trips that **START** at the timekeeper's assigned bus stop
- Trips that merely pass through cannot be modified
- Requires mandatory reason for audit trail

## API Requirements (Pending Backend Implementation)

### 1. Get Assigned Bus Stop

```
GET /api/timekeeper/profile
```

### 2. Filter Trips by Bus Stop

```
GET /api/trips?busStopId={id}&...
```

### 3. Update Bus Assignment

```
PATCH /api/trips/{tripId}/bus-assignment
```

### 4. Trip Starting Stop Information

Add to TripResponse:

```typescript
{
  startingStopId: string;
  startingStopName: string;
}
```

## Current Limitations (Mock Data)

⚠️ **Temporary implementations that need backend integration:**

1. **Assigned Bus Stop**: Hardcoded to "Main Terminal"

   - Replace with user.assignedBusStop from auth context

2. **Trip Starting Point Check**: Always returns true

   - Replace with trip.startingStopId === assignedBusStopId

3. **Bus Assignment Update**: Console logs only

   - Replace with actual API call

4. **Bus Stop Filtering**: Loads all trips
   - Replace with busStopId API parameter

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Modal opens when clicking bus reassignment button
- [ ] Can select "Remove" or "Reassign" option
- [ ] Bus dropdown populates with available buses
- [ ] Reason field is required
- [ ] Cannot reassign to same bus
- [ ] Success message shows after confirmation
- [ ] Trips reload after reassignment
- [ ] Only eligible trips show reassignment button
- [ ] View and Add Notes buttons still work

## Files Modified/Created

**Created:**

- `src/components/timeKeeper/trips/BusReassignmentModal.tsx`

**Modified:**

- `src/app/timeKeeper/(authenticated)/trip/page.tsx`
- `src/components/timeKeeper/trips/TimeKeeperTripsTable.tsx`
- `docs/timekeeper-trip-management-implementation.md`

## Next Steps for Backend Team

1. Add `busStopId` parameter to trips API
2. Add `startingStopId` field to TripResponse
3. Create bus assignment update endpoint
4. Add assigned bus stop to user profile API
5. Implement audit logging for bus changes

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time trip status updates via WebSockets
- Mobile-optimized interface for field use
- Delay reporting capability
- Passenger count tracking at stops
- Bus condition reporting
- Schedule conflict alerts
- Offline mode support
