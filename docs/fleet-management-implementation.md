# Fleet Management Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a comprehensive fleet management page for the Bus Operator portal, inspired by the MOT portal's bus listing page but tailored specifically for operator use.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Fleet Statistics Dashboard
- **FleetStatsCards.tsx**: Displays key metrics including:
  - Total Buses
  - Active/Inactive Buses  
  - Average & Total Capacity
  - Pending Maintenance

### 2. Advanced Search & Filtering
- **FleetAdvancedFilters.tsx**: Comprehensive filtering system with:
  - Real-time search (registration number, plate number, model)
  - Status filtering (Active, Inactive, Pending, Cancelled)
  - Capacity range filtering
  - Model-based filtering
  - Clear active filters functionality
  - Debounced search for performance

### 3. Fleet Data Table
- **FleetTable.tsx**: Full-featured data table with:
  - Sortable columns
  - Responsive design
  - Action buttons (View, Edit, Assign Route, Schedule Maintenance, Delete)
  - Status badges with appropriate colors
  - Loading states
  - Empty states with helpful messages

### 4. Action Management
- **FleetActionButtons.tsx**: Primary action buttons for:
  - Add New Bus
  - Export Fleet Data
  - Schedule Maintenance
  - Generate Fleet Reports

### 5. API Integration
- Uses **BusOperatorOperationsService** for operator-specific API calls
- Proper pagination with **PageBusResponse** model
- Error handling and loading states
- Operator-specific data filtering (only shows buses belonging to the logged-in operator)

## Technical Implementation

### API Service Usage
```typescript
BusOperatorOperationsService.getOperatorBuses(
  operatorId,
  page, 
  size,
  sortBy,
  sortDir,
  status,
  searchText,
  minCapacity,
  maxCapacity
)
```

### Components Structure
```
src/components/operator/fleet/
├── FleetStatsCards.tsx
├── FleetActionButtons.tsx  
├── FleetAdvancedFilters.tsx
├── FleetTable.tsx
└── index.ts
```

### Page Implementation
- Full Next.js App Router compatibility
- Auth context integration
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Responsive design following operator portal patterns

## Design Patterns Followed

### From MOT Portal
- Layout structure and spacing
- Color schemes and status indicators
- Table design and interaction patterns
- Filter UI components
- Loading and error states

### Operator-Specific Adaptations
- Simplified interface focused on operator needs
- Fleet-specific actions (maintenance scheduling)
- Operator-scoped data (only their buses)
- Tailored metrics relevant to fleet operations

## Authentication Integration
- Uses AuthContext for user authentication
- Operator ID derived from authenticated user
- Fallback to mock data for development

## Error Handling
- Comprehensive error states
- Graceful degradation
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states for all async operations
- **Facilities Data Handling**: Robust parsing of facilities data that handles various data types (arrays, objects, JSON strings) safely

## Bug Fixes Applied
- **Facilities JSON Parsing Error**: Fixed the "[object Object] is not valid JSON" error by implementing a robust `formatFacilities` helper function that safely handles different data types for bus facilities without assuming the data format

## Export Functionality
- CSV export of fleet data
- Includes all relevant bus information
- Timestamped file naming

## Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive table with horizontal scrolling
- Adaptive button layouts
- Touch-friendly interface

## Future Enhancements
1. Real-time fleet tracking integration
2. Maintenance scheduling workflow
3. Route assignment interface
4. Advanced reporting dashboard
5. Push notifications for fleet updates
