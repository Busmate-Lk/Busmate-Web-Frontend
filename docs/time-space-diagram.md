# Time-Space Diagram Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a new **Route Analysis** tab to the schedule viewing page that displays a Time-Space Diagram - the most effective way to visualize transport schedules for planning purposes.

## What is a Time-Space Diagram?

A Time-Space Diagram is a graphical representation where:
- **X-axis**: Represents time (hours of the day)
- **Y-axis**: Represents distance/position along the route (from start to end)
- **Lines**: Each schedule appears as a diagonal line showing bus progression through stops over time
- **Multiple lines**: All schedules on the same route are shown together for comparison

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Components

1. **TimeSpaceDiagram.tsx** - Main visualization component
   - Interactive Chart.js-based diagram
   - Responsive design
   - Color-coded schedule lines
   - Hover tooltips with detailed stop information
   - Current schedule highlighting (thicker line)

2. **ScheduleRouteAnalysisTab.tsx** - Tab container component  
   - Fetches all schedules for the parent route
   - Route information display
   - Schedule analysis summary
   - Error handling and loading states

3. **Integration** - Added to existing schedule details page
   - New "Route Analysis" tab in ScheduleTabsSection
   - Seamless integration with existing tab system

### âœ… Technical Features

- **Auto-calculation**: Distance mapping from route stop data
- **Time parsing**: Converts schedule times to chart coordinates  
- **API integration**: Uses existing ScheduleManagementService
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with existing API models
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data

## How It Helps Transport Planners

### ðŸŽ¯ Service Gap Analysis
- **Visual gaps**: Easy to spot time periods with no service
- **Frequency analysis**: See headway between consecutive schedules
- **Coverage assessment**: Identify under-served time periods

### ðŸ“Š Schedule Optimization
- **Overlap detection**: Find schedules that are too close together
- **Timing conflicts**: Spot potential operational issues
- **Resource planning**: Better bus and driver allocation

### ðŸ“ˆ Performance Insights
- **Speed comparison**: Different schedule speeds visible as line slopes
- **Stop time analysis**: Dwell times at stations clearly visible
- **Pattern recognition**: Identify peak vs off-peak service patterns

## Usage

### In Schedule Details Page

1. Navigate to any schedule: `/mot/schedules/[scheduleId]`
2. Click the **"Route Analysis"** tab
3. View the Time-Space Diagram showing:
   - Current schedule (highlighted)
   - All other schedules on the same route
   - Interactive hover information
   - Route and schedule statistics

### Demo Page

Visit `/demo/time-space-diagram` to see a working example with sample data.

## Technical Architecture

```
/src/components/mot/schedule-details/
â”œâ”€â”€ TimeSpaceDiagram.tsx              # Main visualization component
â”œâ”€â”€ tabs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ScheduleRouteAnalysisTab.tsx  # Tab wrapper with data fetching
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts                      # Updated exports
â””â”€â”€ ScheduleTabsSection.tsx           # Updated tab integration
```

### Data Flow

1. **Schedule Page** loads current schedule and route data
2. **Route Analysis Tab** fetches all schedules for the route
3. **Time-Space Diagram** processes data into chart format:
   - Maps stop names to distances using route data
   - Converts arrival times to minutes from midnight
   - Creates chart datasets with proper styling
4. **Chart.js** renders interactive diagram

### Dependencies Used

- `chart.js` & `react-chartjs-2` - For interactive charts
- Existing API services - No new dependencies added
- Lucide React icons - For consistent UI

## Data Requirements

For optimal visualization, schedules need:
- âœ… **Schedule stops** with arrival/departure times
- âœ… **Route data** with stop distances
- âœ… **Stop name mapping** between schedule and route

The component gracefully handles missing data with informative messages.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for Phase 2:
- **Bidirectional view**: Show outbound and inbound on same diagram
- **Real-time overlay**: Add live bus positions
- **Schedule editing**: Direct editing from the diagram
- **Export features**: Save diagrams as images/PDFs
- **Comparison mode**: Compare schedules across different time periods

## Example Output

The diagram shows multiple colored lines representing different schedules:
- Each point = scheduled stop time
- Line slope = travel speed between stops  
- Current schedule highlighted with thicker line
- Hover for detailed timing information

This implementation provides transport planners with the industry-standard visualization tool for effective schedule planning and optimization.
